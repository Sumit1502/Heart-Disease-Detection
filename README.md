# Heart-Disease-Detection
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features, the model can determine whether a patient is at risk of developing heart disease. The project employs classification algorithms to train the model on patient data, allowing for accurate and early detection of heart disease. This tool can be beneficial for healthcare professionals in assessing heart health and providing preventative care.
